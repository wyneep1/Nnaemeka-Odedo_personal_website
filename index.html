            <p>
                I am a sophomore studying Computer Science at Georgia State University, based in Atlanta, Georgia. I have a strong interest in cybersecurity and backend development. I have experience with programming languages such as Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. In my free time I like to go to the gym to lift weights, as well as watch animes such as Hunter x Hunter, Demon Slayer, and One Piece. I also recently became fascinated with Youtuber named MrBallen whose content is based on true crime cases/mysteries. A fun fact about me is that I am a dual citizen of both the U.S and Nigeria.

            <p>Some of my most recent work include a to-do list app, and an online book library. Currently, I am being sponsored by Codepath and Workday to complete a full-stack web development internship where I will brush up on my HTML, CSS, and javascript skills, as well as learn new languages such as React, Node.js/Express, Postgres, SQL,and Heroku. I will also be introduced to APIs and frameworks such as MongoDB, GraphQL, AWS, D3.js and Kafa. </p>
